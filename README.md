# **SentimentSphere: Unveiling Gamer Insights through Advanced NLP and Growth Hacking Strategies**

## **Project Overview**
This project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and extract actionable insights for a video game startup’s growth hacking strategy. By understanding customer sentiment and preferences regarding competitors' products, we identify key factors that influence gamers' buying decisions, empowering the marketing team to craft targeted messaging for the company’s product.

## **Objectives**
As an NLP Specialist on the Growth Hacking Team, your tasks include:

1. **Dataset Acquisition**:
   - Download and prepare a dataset of Amazon reviews focused on video games.
   - Create a custom dataset tailored for sentiment analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Assign sentiment scores ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive) to each review.
   - Compare sentiment scores to review ratings to evaluate your analyzer's performance.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Assess the sentiment analyzer’s accuracy.
   - Explore advanced methods to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Insights Extraction**:
   - Summarize findings for the Growth Hacking Team.
   - Highlight customer preferences and dislikes about video games.

## **Techniques and Tools**
This project employs a range of NLP techniques to derive deeper insights into customer opinions:

- **Dataset Balancing**: Use the `imbalanced-learn` package to handle imbalanced datasets.
- **Dictionary-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Leverage tools from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to compute sentiment scores.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Use `scikit-learn` for metrics and model evaluation.
- **Deep Learning with DistilBERT**: Implement state-of-the-art transformer models with PyTorch and the `simpletransformers` library for advanced sentiment analysis.
- **Visualization**: Present findings through visualizations using the `Altair` library.

   - Select the **Video Games 5-core** category under **Small subsets for experimentation**.

2. **Building a Dictionary-Based Sentiment Analyzer**:
   - Develop a tool to classify customer reviews using dictionary-based methods.

3. **Evaluating the Sentiment Analyzer**:
   - Measure and analyze the effectiveness of your dictionary-based tool.

4. **Creating Neural Network-Based Sentiment Analyzers**:
   - Build and train advanced sentiment analysis models using the DistilBERT framework.

5. **Reporting Results**:
   - Summarize findings for the Growth Hacking Team, emphasizing actionable insights.
   - Present descriptive statistics and visualizations to highlight preferences and dislikes.
